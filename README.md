# IATA BCBP FFI
Provides C FFI bindings for the `iata_bcbp` library.

## Usage
Building this library yields a `staticlib` and a `cdylib` crate
exposing C bindings for all features of the `iata_bcbp` library in addition
to an automatically generated header `iata_bcbp_ffi.h`.

### Building for iOS
Follow the latest steps for intalling and building with `cargo-lipo`.
